Lady
====

Lady is a library to save and load savegames for games made in LÃ–VE. It is
based on the fast, robust, richly-featured table serialization library
[Ser](https://github.com/gvx/Ser).

Lady currently supports MiddleClass, SECS and hump.class. Pull requests to add
support for more class implementations are welcome.

Like Ser itself, you can use, distribute and extend Lady under the terms of the
MIT license.

Using it
--------

(A more comprehensive reference can be found below.)

To use Lady, simply require it:

```lua
local lady = require 'lady'
```

Register all your classes at some point before saving or loading:

```lua
-- using MiddleClass:
local Player = lady.register_class(class('Player'))
-- using SECS:
local Player = lady.register_class(class:new(), 'Player')
-- using hump.class:
local Player = lady.register_class(class{}, 'Player')
-- if you prefer, you can register your classes in another place
-- for example, all in the same place:
lady.register_class(Player, 'Player')
lady.register_class(Enemy, 'Enemy')
lady.register_class(Goal, 'Goal')
```

When you want to save your game:

```lua
lady.save_all(user_input, player, enemy_list, goal_list)
```

And to load:

```lua
player, enemy_list, goal_list = lady.load_all(selected_name)
```

Reference
---------

###`lady.register_class(class[, classname])`

Registers `class`. It will be expected that the argument `classname` is
provided. If absent, `class.name` will be used instead. The name of the class
should be a string that contains a valid Lua identifier.

This function returns `class`, so it can be used as a decorator.

###`lady.save_all(filename, ...)`

Saves the values passed as additional arguments to the `filename` provided.
`love.filesystem` is used, so it can be found in the
[save directory](http://love2d.org/wiki/love.filesystem).

###`lady.save_all(filename)`

Returns the values saved in the `filename` provided. `love.filesystem` is used,
so it looks in the [save directory](http://love2d.org/wiki/love.filesystem).

The values are returned in the same order as they were passed to
`lady.save_all`.

No constructors will be called for any of the objects directly or indirectly
loaded.
